Welcome to the Silver Press! We are an unbiased news aggregation source that provides rational referenced information about topics most consider heated or controversial.

Is the world you live in exactly correct to the best of your knowledge? Could there be such things as 'hidden agendas' and 'auxiliary motives' behind many of the events we witness everyday in life, especially the major ones? And even without the idea of any conspiracy, can we even state that what goes on around us globally is sane for the most part, as in...in line with well posed thinking and paralleling logical standards? Can we even claim the current state of affairs is morally sensible?

*We aim to explore these notions.*

How?

>  With reason and logical thinking.

We hope you enjoy this journey for the truth and question for yourself, because our motto is:

> don't just think. think for yourself. +
