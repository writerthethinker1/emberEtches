preview: "Do gov'ts today put jobs that aid the economy above the health of their citizens? We aim to provide rational logical explanations for the claim: 'national principles are valued over the welfare of its citizens'. In particular, we examine one event that happened that exemplifies (conspiracy or not) that nations are slowly becoming totalitarian in interests which the entails a devaluing of the citizen into an object. Rationally, major gov't actions are rather...questionable. Truth awaits!"

## Why somethings don't make sense (rationally)

Conspiracy or not, some things or events don't make rational or ethical sense. We'll share one event in history: 9/11.

Here's why 9/11 (the collapse of the twin towers in the US) didn't make ethical sense to us, conspiracy or not:

* The guards didn't allow people to leave once the first building was destroyed. They didn't let people who might actually want to save their own lives leave for the sake of 'productivity'. In addition, those guards didn't care about their own lives as well. Even those who quit their job due to a hazard. There were no evacuation plans in case of an external disaster, even high schools and elementary schools have evacuation plans.
* World trading resumed without much media controversy nor any signs of major economic collapse. trading still was had post building demolish without any deficits to citizen's ways of life.
* Mere economic trading was placed first above citizen's lives. We lived in a time where the health of a citizen was neglected over a single day of work. If trade did resume shortly thereafter, couldn't we have given unemployment benefits to those without jobs were they allowed to leave? At least on the first floor?
 > It's just one work shift, we can still resume work at a different location, in a different building and there is cash we can inject for a small proportion of people who's lives were saved by leaving. Leaving because a building collapsed isn't like that person wanted a vacation right now. It is something unexpected and we should **all look out for ourselves and help those in need right now.**

These points alone make us question what happened. At least to the point, where one can wonder the reality of what happened. Was there at least one person who actually wanted to leave rather than work for the sake of productivity? At least near to the point of evacuation? Instead, racial profiling happened and since then we live in a time where people use stereotypes as rules of thumb for association. This is all from logic and ethical appeals.

> Sometimes political agendas and ways of thought can get in the way of peace and calm evacuation. Thankfully, in a time like 2021, we can have all those past notions put aside and be more rational. We doubt unreasonable thinking like that, productivity over a citizen's health, will ever return. This event marks a cold mistake and exemplifies a need for the last sentence to be true.

Thank you for reading and questioning with us. $\silver$
