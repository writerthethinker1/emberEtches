Welcome to the Silver Press! We are an *unbiased* *ad-free* news aggregation source that provides rational referenced information about topics most consider heated or controversial. You can enjoy your favorite controversial news without the annoying ads in between too!

Could there be such things as **hidden agendas** and **auxiliary motives** behind many of the events we witness everyday in life, especially major ones? And even without the idea of any conspiracy, can we even state that what goes on around us globally is sane for the most part, as in...in line with well posed thinking and paralleling **logical standards?** Can we even claim the current state of affairs is sensible?

> We use *reason, logical thinking, and credible references* to give you answers to some questions about conspiracies, all in an online article format.

### Can I Request an Article?

Absolutely! For a small fee, you can directly send us an inquiry detailing what conspiracy theory you want a logical analysis of and how strong of an analysis you need. You also get to keep a PDF document of the article signed by the writers with the *silver sign* to authenticate it! Enjoy!

### Wait, can we go deeper?

If you like the articles, there are books too! They are reasonably priced and give you a critical look inside big corporations, greed, environmental decline, and hidden agendas. Topics include: **Big Pharma, Planned Genocides, UFOs, Weather Manipulation, Bermuda Triangle, Alchemy, Hidden Technology, Secret Societies, New World Order, and so on.** All that and more as books!

> Your purchases/donations help us build the site better, make more articles, and go further into conspiracies. End corporate greed and corruption!

We hope you enjoy this journey for the truth and question for yourself, because our motto is...

> "Think freely and speak freely in the quest for *truth*..." --- Silver Press
