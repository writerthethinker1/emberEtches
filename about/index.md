Welcome to the Silver Press! We are an *unbiased* news aggregation source that provides rational referenced information about topics most consider heated or controversial. We explain them in a *cool manner* so as to keep happy vibes while still maintaining awareness. It all started off with the model question(s) way back in December 2020...

Could there be such things as **'hidden agendas'** and **'auxiliary motives'** behind many of the events we witness everyday in life, especially major ones? And even without the idea of any conspiracy, can we even state that what goes on around us globally is sane for the most part, as in...in line with well posed thinking and paralleling **logical standards?** Can we even claim the current state of affairs is sensible? If so...**how can we be proactive about it rather than be slumped down in thought, reactive?**

> "Sure this issue is not able to be tolerated well both physically and mentally, but in spite of this, are there still things we can do about it? Can we still react calmly and with reason toward many events that bother us so that we don't feel the effects *long term*?" --- Silver Press

Knowing this, what's the best way to address an inquiry? Critical as in...a short but thorough means to find truth in things. We use *reason, logical thinking, and credible references!*

We hope you enjoy this journey for the truth and question for yourself, because our motto is...
