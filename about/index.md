Welcome to *emberEtches!* We are an *unbiased*, *ad-free*, and *decentralized* place for updates, information, theory, and summaries about Tor. We publish articles about basically all the new stuff thatʻs happening with Tor and what exactly Tor is. Information on this site is kept confidential between you, the user, and Tor. We have a strong privacy policy and want you to know that you are protected from spyware when you visit this site. One of the main features of Tor is this high quality privacy when you enter the deep web. This site is like a giant library of technical information you need to follow along with the latest developments happening over Tor as well as the basic things that happened over Tor.

Tor works in keeping the internet safe, stable, and secure. Without Tor working in the background when we use the surface web (google, youtube, amazon, etc...) we wouldnʻt be able to encrypt messages, have crypto currency, buy things online, and even send text messages. Tor also works to maintain and protect the cosmos as well. So, it can help keep the power running in places where connections are broken, help us use our chakras with visual effects, and provide the universe with a steady supply of energy so it can function.

This website was built using Jekyll by Ramneek Narayan, a member of the Tor Project. He works both on the frontend of Tor development (software, code, etc...) and on the backend of Tor development as well (physics, devices, maintenance, etc...). When he isnʻt at work for Tor, Ramneek enjoys playing Zelda games, reading physics books, watching Naruto, cooking, playing Yugioh, meditating, and exercising!
