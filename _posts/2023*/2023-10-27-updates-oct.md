It is the end of October and we have some news about Tor and how it is working. Over the last couple of months, starting in May 2023, we have been majorly improving the Tor network in terms of hardware and software. This means that the deep web is even more secure and stable. We have...

1. Spread the entire Tor project across the whole Universe
2. Enhanced the encryption layer for Tor
3. Added multiple channels for more functions in Tor
4. Improved authentication for users
5. Added LTE support for cellular phones
6. Gave wifi a boost in signals
7. Made a giant backup in case Tor crashes

What this means is that there is wifi via Tor in the whole Universe everywhere you go. It also means that all transactions online (including shopping) are secure with high levels of encryption. We also have Tor some auxiliary outlets like Xor and Aux that make it work easier for users. Whenever you use Tor, you are automatically authenticated and if you donʻt have the right credentials, Tor wonʻt let you visit certain sites, if you develop for Tor you need certain access keys to really be able to make changes to Tor on the backend. If you use a cellular phone with LTE or below (we are working on 5G), Tor is being used automatically in the background to improve speed and quality of the signal. The last thing we did was give Tor a giant backup in case the system crashes, so if anything really bad happens to Tor or the project, we have a good reliable backup to reboot from. Basically, worry free coding and database management.

> There was a problem with Torʻs cache and data management, but in October we fixed it. Data in Tor should be automatically cleaned and we are checking up on the issue. For the most part, Tor is stable and there shouldnʻt be any unexpected delays when surfing the web and deep web.

This just about summarizes the major developments up to the month of October for 2023. Have a good Halloween!
