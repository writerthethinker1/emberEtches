title: Spike Proteins! (Revised)
category: covid-19
preview: "Could there be harm to the spike proteins that make up the viral particle known as sars-cov-2 that has ruined our ways of life and economy? And...if so, what can we do about them? In this article, we explore logical and natural remedies toward improving our health against them. Updated on August 28, 2021."

## Spike Proteins, Are They Here?

With the cases or corona globally, there might be a rise in the number of spike proteins in the **food, air, and clothes we wear.**

> My opinion is that they absorb and linger easily in tissues of the body that are spongy and absorbent. Organs like, lungs, kidneys, endocrine glands, liver, intestines, and even the nerves in the body can have these protein spikes from corona virus.

Personally, it can be helpful and encouraging to know that there are things we can do about them, at least to the point where they aren't high in number in the body. I'll  give you a summary of what I found out about treating them:

> 1. when in liquid, it is hard to heat them up and have them not be harmful to body. e.g. water boiled at 175F still has them do damage to body
> 2.  when on dry items, heating them in really hot pans neutralizes their effect
> 3. they leave with the breath
> 4. magnetization helps greatly in reducing their effects

Are there things the spikes might not thrive in? Well, *we don't yet know from any medical theories...* However, if I tried to make the best choices in this, I would say that there are certain things that the spikes do not thrive in.[^1]

All of the examples below have logical marks which are included and serve as models for things spike proteins do not like to thrive in. Maybe the following will be some protection from them, all natural:

> Note that this does NOT substitute for medical advice; if you're feeling sick and under the weather, please see a medical professional trained in addressing covid-19 infections.

1. Tonic water
   * This has quinine in it which is **anti-malaria**.[^2]

2. **Lemon and Copper**
   * Both have anti-viral properties. You can find copper in pistachios and dark chocolate for instance. And you can drink freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice in the morning with some water.[^3][^4]

3. **Coconut oil**
   * Also anti-viral.[^5]
4. Tube Lights
   * While a bit odd, there might be some logic to this as UV lights were used once to neutralize corona virus particles.[^6] I find the iPhone screen light can help if you use it on items. Common tube lights with helium sold in stores cheaply I suspect are useful.

5. **Spearmint**
   * Teas, essential oil, and leaf all have menthol which is good for breathing.[^7]

6. **Exercise**
   * It increases testosterone production.[^8]

7. **Meditation & Breathing Techniques**
   * Can help body rejuvenate itself and stay healthy.[^9][^10]
8. **Cold Showers**
   * Can help body in strengthening it's immune system. Definitely this will help...[^11]
9. **Vitamin D**
   * Can help immune system.[^12]
10. Pumpkin Seeds
    * Contains levels of **zinc**, which can also help the immune system.[^13]
11. **Choline** & Inositol
    * This is good for the liver.[^14]
12. **Ginko Bilboa**
    * This is a memory enhancer as well as a blood thinner.[^15][^16]
13. **Turmeric**
    * This can help with any inflammation going on in the body.[^17]
14. Emergen-C
    * Just a personal recommendation, I've taken it and feel better each time I do. There are various minerals and vitamins in them which contribute to mood. It's over the counter and available in most markets. Good for the mood.
15. Roasted Seaweed
    * This has iodine.[^18]
16. **Flax Seed Oil & Fish**
    * High in **Omega-3s**.[^19]
17. **Bitter Melon Power or Real Bitter Melon**
    * Good for blood sugar, I suspect the pancreas is affected by the spike proteins as well. Vitamin C as well. The leaves are also **anti-malaria** and you can make a tea out of them...[^20]
18. Ginger
    * Good for inflammation as well as **blood flow**.[^21]
19. Cardomom
    * Anti-inflammatory and good for the digestive tract. Also aids in breathing and oxygen supply to the lungs.[^22]
20. Clove Bud
    * Anti-inflammatory properties and rich in manganese, important for brain health. Manganese might also be something the spikes do not thrive in.[^23]
21. Cayanne Pepper
    * These show signs of aiding digestive health.[^24]
22. Taro root/leaves
    * This root vegetable is high in copper, and somehow is not a setting the spikes like.[^25]
23. Green Tea/Leafy Greens
    * Rich in Vitamin K, something I suspect that is unsuitable for the spikes. Kale might also help. Maybe a cup each day or a smoothie with kale in it.[^26]
24. **Celery**
    * Has vitamins A, C, and K which might be unsuitable for the unhealthy protein spikes.[^27]

###  What's the pattern?

From observation, it looks like the patterns that personally helped my health were going with things *anti-parasitic*, particularly malaria. I found the following changes to lifestyle beneficial and maybe you will too following them...

1. exercise (set amount of time each day)
2. lots of omega3s
3. choline & inositol as essential
4. vitamin D3
5. ginko bilboa or other blood thinners (natural) like cinnamon
6. cold showering
7. drinking 10-20oz of water right when you wake up
8. making a tea using lemon, bitter melon, peppermint, and holy basil
9. meditation & breathing exercises
10. coconut oil as essential (extra virgin)
11. making sure you have an even bowel movement each day; more bowels makes you feel worse, *be regular*. A colon cleanse might not be to shabby especially if you aren't regular often.
12. having probiotics
13. wearing some *magnetic material* to help essential nutrients absorb well; maybe *compression clothes* with copper in them.
14. keeping the blood sugar a little low with some cinnamon prior to meals
15. taking zinc supplements

These tips helped me have a better quality of living.

### In Summary

The spikes arenâ€™t healthy, at all. For some reason, I suspect that saliva can help stop their negative effects, at least to some degree; something to do with denaturing them...

> **Why I warn about protein spikes:** they get stuck or nested in tissues. They have a hard time leaving body on their own and are *retained in body tissues.* Then they cause more problems. One might have more bodily problems such as increased thirst or more hunger from overactive immune system.

Thankfully, there are things we can do about them. Clean living and adherence to a healthy diet with the items above as well as deep breathing exercises can reduce their impact.

*Stay healthy and calm.* $\silver$
