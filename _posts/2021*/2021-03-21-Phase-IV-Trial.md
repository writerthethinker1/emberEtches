category: covid-19
preview: "What exactly is a phase IV trial, colloquially and scientifically? Is it okay to stop a phase IV trial when an 'emergency' use authorization is declared as is the case with many of the vaccines we use internationally? If it is, how will this affect the efficacy of the vaccines? Will we possibly risk side effects we can't know of right now, and if so...what can we do to mitigate risks? All that and more in this article!"

## Phase IV trials: what are they?

Phase IV trials are part of the four trial phases before any drug approved for widespread use including vaccines, over the counter drugs, prescribed drugs, and other medicinal items solely for health use. It is the last one before legal use is possible. All drugs one buys have at least undergone some trial process before they reach the markets and the process is usually done, without any major constraints, using a four trial method. Without going into too depth into the first 3 phases, we will entirely discuss the last trial phase: *phase four*, due to its **controversial cancellation** by major pharmaceutical companies such as **pfizer, moderna, and others.** We'll talk about the definition, means, products, risks, and when companies might be able to not have a phase IV trial due to social constraints. All for better awareness.

### What is a phase four trial?

In a biomedical setting, a phase IV trial is defined as follows:

> **Phase 4 trial:** A phase IV trial is the last in a sequence of trials that gives doctors and trial patients as well as pharmaceutical companies evidence for *effectiveness* about a particular drug. Phase IV trials are more general in sample and their inferences range in time and are more applicable. Data collected from a phase IV trial helps with assessing the long term effects of a certain medicine as well as the minorities or majorities of people involved in them. As a result, the drug in question also is called into inquiry in terms of popularity and usage among physicians either locally or globally.[^1][^2]

Major pharmaceutical companies decide whether to popularize the drug and share knowledge they have about it to the target physicians; they also plan profits and manufacturing as well.[^1] A phase IV trial is a generalization of a phase III trial which showed local *efficacy* for a certain illness among a *selected (randomly) minority of people*.[^2] Data collected from a phase IV trial is *always* stronger than data collected from a phase III trial and economic constraints such as time and resource allocation (money, tools, and subjects) might prohibit one form occurring.

Notice that the inference from a phase III trial is *not* generalizable to a majority of people nor are the *long term effects* of a drug known in certainty. Lacking data and adequate analysis from a phase IV trial researchers, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies have data relative to *short term effects* and *relative to certain classes or groups of people*. During covid-19, funding was sufficient to have trials operate efficiently, have tools and resources to adequately run a data analysis and many more other things suitable for a rigorous analysis.[^3] *However, the length of time, participants, and data collection all stay the same, even in a phase III trial*. Regardless of funding, a solid inference will always take time and careful precision. Primarily funding allows for more techniques of developing medical treatments. Which begs the question:

> Q: If there was so much funding given to the makers of the sars-cov-2 vaccines, where did the allocation for the fourth trial go? Was all the fund money used solely for the vaccines? Encouraging more volunteers and spreading word on what samples one needs to have a better inference? Did the funds go there or not? And what of the funds now?

### Consequences of not having a Phase IV Trial

Each decision has a risk and a benefit to most people. Having one thing means having at a risk. What might be the risks and benefits of not having a phase IV trial as was the case with companies such as pfizer during November 2020? The immediate ones are given:

> **Risks:** When a company decides to not go through with a phase IV trial, the vaccine they give is conditional on the data that they have. Meaning, their reason for giving you and everyone else a vaccine is from the expectation they have about the trials. If their data excludes others who will also buy their product, *it has a higher chance of not being effective and/or having side-effects*. In effect, this inadvertently lowers the quality of the drug. All drugs come with a caveat, more for some than others. The way we can tell before injecting masses of people is by careful well designed studies. The risk for not having a phase IV trial is taking what some might call an 'experimental' vaccine that might not work for select people due to sampling representation. This entails side-effects as well as death for a portion of people 'unexpected' a priori (beforehand).
>
> **Benefits:** At the same time, were chance in the favour of the company, the drug just might work for the people who are having it. It might actually work to cure or give immunity against a disease in terms of efficacy rate, and the effect comes sooner than the time it takes for a well done phase IV trial. The benefit for rushing shipments of vaccines is massive injections that might work well. The portion of people who will have side-effects is kept at the level the companies or policy makers have planned. The downside? *It's a guess at current trial data. A big guess considering millions of others will be injected in the long run.*

In short, lacking evidence from a phase IV trial, pharmaceutical companies metaphorically 'play a game of chance' where the utility of rushed vaccines working for the majority of the population is greater than the utility of having a truly effective vaccine, which can be freely administered with a decreased tendency to give users side-effects, muscle aches, and fatigue.

**Remark:** *They value profits and yield more than a careful analysis. Maybe out of 'pandemic fear'. Maybe the profit is coincidental. Maybe.*

> Notice: The decision is made by both the pharmaceutical companies and the government of the country one lives in. And if sufficient numbers of people do not consent to vaccination by a set time, they might be forced into it, either by law or work related demand. **Critically, while legal, is this humanitarian? Is it humanitarian to force others to consent to a vaccination out of employment or legal rule?** We leave it up to the reader to question.

### Lastly, emergency use authorization

So, when might we legally not have a phase IV trial?

> It is allowed by an 'emergency use authorization' nationally during uncertain times.

What exactly is an 'emergency use authorization' with respect to experimental drugs, and why might times call for one? How can we still be moderately wise in decision making in spite of this?

> An emergency use authorization is a call given by the government you live in to authorize the companies for the vaccine that sounds effective, i.e. given for mass production and distribution. It is given only by the people who run the FDA and who have influence over it in the US. Note, however, that just because a drug has this authorization doesn't mean that it is effective as stated and *the companies with this authorization still have to conduct phase IV trials or continue up with studies for use outside of the emergency window as a follow-up.*[^4] Note also that the companies are responsible for reporting the haphazards and ill outcomes to the FDA for people among those who received the vaccine during the emergency use period for general use.[^4]

In the case of sars-cov-2, pfizer, moderna, and many others might be taking notice to the people with minor to major side-effects and logging them for their own analysis for people later who might need the vaccines. All assuming covid-19 doesn't clear up in the short run. *This implies perhaps better versions of them in the future should covid pose a significant risk.* If not, covid is no longer a threat to our existence and vaccine data might just be logged.

Above all else, please question what's going on around you and take your right to not be vaccinated if you think it will harm you. Given that others have suffered death and side-effects conditional on an injection[^5][^6], check up on your own condition and make sure you have a nutritious diet, exercise, and sleep regularly to ensure your body can take the vaccine. If you don't feel well, it's not worth the risk. *This is all our opinion and does not constitute medical advice; always check in with your doctor for a final word if you want their opinion too.*

Stay informed and don't blindly accept what's happening around you. It's a way to be in touch with the world!
