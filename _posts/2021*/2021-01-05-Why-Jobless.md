## Why are we jobless?

---

During this time, we are in what is known as a 'pandemic' meaning that there is a global viral particle called 'sars-cov-2' that is in high quantities and has caused high infection rates. This much the entire world has felt to some degree. This pandemic has consequently made major policy makers around the world enact what is called 'social distancing' and the shutting down of businesses due to lack of demand from social distancing as well as viral spread containment. With scientific data and information, we do know that infection rates can be slowed down due to *open air*, *moderate distancing*, and *good immune system functioning*.[^1] That much is true which means that social distancing, if done moderately, can help minimize the number of people who become infected. We can not avoid it to keep cases low, but...to completely shut down businesses and lose major jobs as well as create hysteria about covid-19 from major shut downs is rather questionable. And we have yet to know if excess social distancing can help largely in reducing the number of cases rather than marginally.

> Q: If we shut down most businesses and restrict travel and mandate mask wearing without scientific evidence (or holding of evidence), what might happen to the people who don't have any other means to work?

> Q: What happens to people when they are unemployed and how long can a gov't keep supporting them without causing economic harm?

We are losing jobs not because of mere lack of demand. There is lack of demand, however, the cause of this lack is exclusively due to: policy making to reduce spread of the viral particle (social distancing). When policy makers chose to enact heavy social distancing, the immediate consequence is to have small bussinesses lose demand and have major lifestyle changes that accompanies a solitary confined and rather distant life supported by virtual communication.

> Policy makers are usually experienced enough to know that certain people will be unemployed as their income is from their businesses or businesses that must shut down from social distancing like restaurants and hotels. Hence the money that was injected into the economy. In spite of this, people lack funds for essential items like food and clothing. Then...is policy making sufficient for preventing any minor economic hardships right now? Has it been effective over this year with regards to covid-19? The people who are unemployed are not out of choice, they want to work and earn money and some even enjoyed their work, they are doing so out of governmental orders and using minor unemployment checks to get by right now.

We don't criticize policy making, rather we view current policies effectiveness' on what it is trying to address and how one policy conditions another. For example, social distancing and cash injections into the economy come hand in hand meaning from the former there must come the latter to prevent homelessness of people who are in economic 'tight-spots' or hardships.

People started to use alternative means of work such as virtual conferencing via popular platforms known as 'zoom' and 'Skype'. But, this was for those who could work remotely like computer developers and telephone operators.

> Q: ...how about others with incompatible jobs that couldn't be virtual?

For others such as hotel keepers and people who's job nature relied on physical means and had to be done 'in-person', they ended up losing their jobs or were layed-off as little demand was had. Plus, a cultural change to digital life promoted by social distancing has caused a shift in what things people favor in their free time. People sometimes favor eating out on days when they have work in-person or perhaps when in social gatherings. People also like traveling more when there are less restrictions and worry-free mentality toward being sick. During those times, demand for hotels and other in-person jobs were high to moderate and the employees could have steady pay checks. With demand gone due to policy making and social distancing, those people saw less and less demand and major policy decisions told them to shut down (temporarily) their stores and shops.

Those people turned to unemployment benefits given by the government by injections into the money supply as part of 'relief aid'. However, this relief aid can never be eternal and certainly never make up for the psychological toll losing one's business and way of life can have. Nor can the amount given be equated to the amount one usually gets with steady demand as in the early parts of 2019. In turn, those who could not afford other means of work and lost their businesses saw little ways to keep their ways of life the same and ultimately had to make sacrifices to maintain the basics like food, clothes, and hygiene.

In addition, many who lost their jobs usually had low levels of education making it harder for them to have sufficient credentials for a back-up job. Major policy makers did nothing to address this possibly knowing it implicitly (meaning joblessness was inevitable in their minds). They did not offer services or at least create any new jobs to alleviate any economic stress by those who were going to be unemployed. There were no major policies supporting...

- remote jobs
- laptop distributions
- wifi and network availability
- advancement of education (higher level of education to Community College at least)

> Ultimately and ironically, policy making by policy makers did not affect them at all.[^2] *They still maintained steady pay and (perhaps) had pay raises* and saw little change to the ways of life they had save minor sedentary surpluses.

For the reader:

* We give up quality of life as well as lack of economic soundness when we enact social distancing on an extreme level as we are doing now. Major businesses had to completely stop operations in-person rather than slow operations in-person and major employers stopped in-person work fully rather than partially. All of this hurt other businesses that relied on them for demand such as local shops, food places and grocery markets. Instead, we saw the rise of major companies such as Walmart, Costco, and tech giants like google and Microsoft reap huge amounts of cash.[^3] It seems that these types of businesses profited (meaning their incomes were graduated during this time to a level higher than what they had during 2019) the most during the pandemic. Sure, we are sad during this time over certain things, but major businesses? *I don't think so due to high profit yield and keeping of high quality of life.*
