title: Spike Proteins!
category: covid-19
preview: "Could there be harm to the spike proteins that make up the viral particle known as sars-cov-2 that has ruined our ways of life and economy? And...if so, what can we do about them? In this article, we explore logical and natural remedies toward improving our health against them."

## Remedy for Spike Proteins

I suspect that with the cases or corona globally, there has been a rise in the number of spike proteins in the **food, air, and clothes we wear.** My opinion is that they absorb and linger easily in tissues of the body that are spongy and absorbent. Organs like, lungs, kidneys, endocrine glands, liver, intestines, and even the nerves in the body can have these protein spikes from corona virus. I suspect corona since that is one major global event right now and the spikes are in the food globally. Personally, I don't think the majority of the population has to worry about these spikes, but for the *1-10% that do and have to adjust to a world filled with them*, it can be helpful and encouraging to know that there are things we can do about them, at least to the point where they aren't high in number in the body. I'll  give you a summary of what I found out about treating them:

* when in liquid, it is hard to heat them up and have them not be harmful to body. e.g. water boiled at 175F still has them do damage to body
* when on dry items, heating them for about (temp) neutralizes them
* they leave with the breath

I have also looked into natural things one can do about treating the spikes so as to find a unsuitable environment for them. There are certain things that the spikes do not thrive in.[^1]

All of the examples have logical marks which are included.  I think the following will be some protection from them:

> Note that this does NOT substitute for medical advice; if you're feeling sick and under the weather, please see a medical professional trained in addressing covid-19 infections.

1. Tonic water
   * This has quinine in it which is anti-malaria.[^2]

2. Lemon and Copper
   * Both have anti-viral properties. You can find copper in pistachios and dark chocolate for instance. And you can drink freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice in the morning with some water. [^3] [^4]

3. Coconut oil
   * Also anti-viral. [^5]
4. Tube Lights
   * While a bit odd, there might be some logic to this as UV lights were used once to neutralize corona virus particles.[^6] I find the iPhone screen light can help if you use it on items. Common tube lights with helium sold in stores cheaply I suspect are useful.

5. Spearmint
   * Teas, essential oil, and leaf all have menthol which is good for breathing. [^7]

6. Exercise
   * Steroids seem to inhibit the corona virus. I noticed the days where I exercised I felt better than when I didn't. [^8]

7. Meditation & Breathing Techniques
   * Can help body rejuvenate itself and stay healthy. I try mindfulness meditation where I am okay with what I think, good or bad, it doesn't matter and removes that 'inner-critic'. [^9] [^10]
8. Cold Showers
   * Can help body in strengthening it's immune system.[^11]
9. Vitamin D
   * Can help immune system. If I have to pick one, I would take Vitamin D2 as the form. Just my guess.[^12]
10. Pumpkin Seeds
    * Contains levels of zinc, which can also help the immune system. If you are a man, hold off on fapping to preserve zinc levels as well as testosterone.[^13]
11. Choline & Inositol
    * This is good for the liver, an organ that might have lots of spikes in it due to tissue composition.[^14]
12. Ginko Bilboa
    * This is a memory enhancer as well as a blood thinner[^15], which can help prevent clotting, a symptom present in post corona syndrome.[^16]
13. Turmeric
    * This can help with any inflammation going on in the body.[^17]
14. Emergen-C
    * Just a personal recommendation, I've taken it and feel better each time I do. There are various minerals and vitamins in them which contribute to mood. It's over the counter and available in most markets. Good for the mood.
15. Roasted Seaweed
    * This has iodine, which is something I suspect the spike proteins do not thrive in.[^18]
16. Flax Seed Oil & Fish
    * High in Omega-3s, especially ALA which can help with nerve maintenance.[^19]
17. Bitter Melon Power or Real Bitter Melon
    * Good for blood sugar, I suspect the pancreas is affected by the spike proteins as well. Vitamin C as well.[^20]
18. Ginger
    * Good for inflammation as well as blood flow.[^21]
19. Cardomom
    * Anti-inflammatory and good for the digestive tract. Also aids in breathing and oxygen supply to the lungs. [^22]
20. Clove Bud
    * Anti-inflammatory properties and rich in manganese, important for brain health. Manganese might also be something the spikes do not thrive in.[^23]
21. Cayanne Pepper
    * These show signs of aiding digestive health.[^24]
22. Taro root/leaves
    * This root vegetable is high in copper, and somehow is not a setting the spikes like.[^25]
23. Green Tea/Leafy Greens
    * Rich in Vitamin K, something I suspect that is unsuitable for the spikes. Kale might also help. Maybe a cup each day or a smoothie with kale in it.[^26]
24. Celery
    * Has vitamins A, C, and K which might be unsuitable for the unhealthy protein spikes.[^27]

#### In Summary

The spikes aren’t healthy, at all. For some reason, I suspect that saliva can help stop their negative effects, at least to some degree.

**Why I warn about protein spikes:** they get stuck or nested in tissues. just like in celery and onion where it is easy for them to be absorbed into. They have a hard time leaving body on their own and are *retained in body tissues.* Then they cause more problems. One might have more bodily problems such as increased thirst or more hunger from overactive immune system.

Thankfully, there are things we can do about them. Clean living and adherence to a healthy diet with the items above as well as deep breathing exercises can reduce their impact.

Will these spikes affect everyone? Who knows? My bet is about 1-10% of the population. Maybe some people can tolerate them. Some of us can’t so we know more of this disease effects on the body.

*Stay healthy and calm.*
